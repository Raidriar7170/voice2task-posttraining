## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Build public sample and local private corpora
The system SHALL build speech-to-contract datasets from sanitized Voice-to-Browser Agent seed artifacts while separating committed public samples from generated local/private corpora.

#### Scenario: Build public sample dataset
- **WHEN** a developer runs the dataset builder in public-sample mode
- **THEN** the system writes a small sanitized JSONL sample that contains spoken command or ASR transcript inputs, target browser task contracts, split labels, and provenance metadata safe for git

#### Scenario: Build local private corpus
- **WHEN** a developer runs the dataset builder with a local seed trace corpus path
- **THEN** the system writes generated train/dev/test JSONL files under a gitignored local artifact directory and emits a manifest with counts, split names, and source summaries

### Requirement: Preserve schema and safety labels during augmentation
The system SHALL support schema-preserving augmentation that changes Chinese phrasing without changing the target browser task contract or safety label.

#### Scenario: Augment a seed example
- **WHEN** the builder expands a seed example into paraphrased Chinese commands
- **THEN** every augmented row retains the original target contract, route decision, safety decision, and confirmation expectation unless an explicit hard-negative row is being generated

### Requirement: Generate hard negative pairs
The system SHALL generate DPO-ready hard negative pairs where rejected contracts are plausible but wrong, unsafe, underspecified, or routed incorrectly.

#### Scenario: Generate DPO pairs
- **WHEN** the builder creates preference data
- **THEN** each pair contains the same input, one chosen browser task contract, one rejected browser task contract, and a rejection reason category

### Requirement: Validate dataset rows
The system SHALL validate every generated dataset row against the browser task contract schema and public/private artifact policy.

#### Scenario: Reject invalid dataset rows
- **WHEN** a row has malformed JSON, a missing required field, an invalid split label, or forbidden local path content in a public artifact
- **THEN** the builder fails validation and reports the row identifier and failure category
